# Lost & Found – A Social Travel Journal  
**By Kyle Versa**

**Lost & Found** is a full-stack travel web app that brings your journeys and daydreams to life through a visual and interactive experience. It’s split into two interconnected sections:

- **Found** – A personal record of past destinations, enriched with reflections and media  
- **Lost** – A curated wishlist of dream destinations, styled with aesthetic flair and thoughtful details

Originally developed as a university portfolio project, *Lost & Found* now stands as a polished MVP for a larger vision:  
a social storytelling platform for travelers — like Letterboxd, but for the world.

## Why This Project?
